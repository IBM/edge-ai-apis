# Welcome to Edge AI API by IBM Research

Edge AI is a computing paradigm that bypasses the need to move vast amounts of data and provides the ability to analyze data at the source. Edge AI APIs, built by IBM Research are a set of RESTful web services with data and AI algorithms to support AI applications across distributed hybrid cloud and edge environments. 

The Edge AI APIs are early access offering from IBM Research to enable AI at the edge. These APIs are general purpose and support many modalities of data, for example, visual, acoustic, sensors, network logs, time series, or natural language. Using these APIs, you can create various AI-based applications. The following image shows the Edge AI high-level architecture.
