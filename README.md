# Welcome to Distributed AI APIs by IBM Research

Distributed AI is a computing paradigm that bypasses the need to move vast amounts of data and provides the ability to analyze data at the source. Distributed AI APIs, built by IBM Research are a set of RESTful web services with data and AI algorithms to support AI applications across distributed hybrid cloud and edge environments. 

The Distributed AI APIs are early access offering from IBM Research to enable AI at the edge and distrbuted environments. These APIs are general purpose and support many modalities of data, for example, visual, acoustic, sensors, network logs, time series, or natural language. Using these APIs, you can create various AI-based applications. The following image shows the Distributed AI high-level architecture.
