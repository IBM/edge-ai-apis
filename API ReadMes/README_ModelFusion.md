# Getting Started with Edge AI Model Fusion API 
Shared ML learning without shared data.

## Overview
As massive amount of data collected at the edge of network, and is it even feasible or cost effective to transport this data to a central location? As data privacy becomes a critical issue as country like Germany with GDPR, i.e.data cannot leave the country boundary or given enterprise premise or geopolitical boundary.

Model Fusion API extends IBM FL framework to solve this edge scenario by only sharing learned Machine Learning models without sharing the raw data distributed across multiple edge sites insuring data privacy.  In addition, the API autonomously learns model and ensemble them from multiple edges. Model Fusion API provides mechanisms to create global and local models when appropriate fine-tune them.

## Version 1.0 API
The following are API services offered for version 1.0:
​
Methods for model fusion:
**1. Start Aggregator**: Aggregator is responsible for orchestration the federated learning environment 
​
**2. Start Party**: Registering a party with the aggregator before joining the federation
​
**3. Train**: Initiate the training
​
**4. Stop**: Ends the federated learning framework to signify end of training
​
**5. Get Weights**: For edge sites to retrieve the weights training is complete
​
## Interpreting the Output

### 1. Start Aggregator
#### Description:
The Aggregator is in charge of running the Fusion Algorithm. A fusion algorithm queries the registered parties to carry out the federated learning process. The queries sent vary according to the model/algorithm type. In return, parties send their reply as a model update object, and these model updates are then aggregated according to the specified Fusion Algorithm, specified via a Fusion Handler class.
#### Arguments:
```
fusion_algorithm: The name of the fusion algorithm for the federation learning process. Options includes `fedavg`, `iter_avg`, and `doc2vec`

model_type: The type of model used for fusion. Options includes 'keras', 'pytorch', and 'doc2vec'

model_file: The saved initial model to distribute to parties to train in isolation

num_parties: The number of nodes participating in the fusion

rounds: The number of fusion rounds to complete

epochs: The number of epochs to to train for each fusion round

learning_rate: The learnig rate for the parties to use for training

optimizer: The name of the optimizer used for training (not applicable for doc2vec). Should be the name used by the keras or pytorch libraries (ex: optim.Adam for pytorch)
```
#### Return:
```
200: Returns success message.
500: Returns error message logged by the server.
```
### 2. Start Party
#### Description:
With the aggregator config file defined, we can start the aggregator from the edgeai_model_fusion service. If successful, the service will return an ID for the parties to use to register with the aggregator.
#### Arguments:
```
aggregator_id: ID of aggregator to connect to for federation
data: Serialized local training dataset isolated from other party
data_handler_class_name: Class name of the datahandler utility
custom_data_handler: Custom datahandler module for non-supported datasets
```
#### Return:
```
200: Returns success message.
500: Returns error message logged by the server.
```
### 3. Train
#### Description:
Starts the global training process. After both Parties register successfully with the aggregator, the federated learning process can begin. We will issue a train command to the model_fusion service to initiate the training.
The aggregator_id parameter is required to initiate the correct aggregator.
Upon successful training, the service should return the model weights of the global model acquired through fusion process.
#### Arguments:
```
None
```
#### Return:
```
200: Returns success message.
500: Returns error message logged by the server.
```
### 4. Stop
#### Description:
Stops the aggregator and all registered party nodes with corresponding ID.
#### Arguments:
```
None
```
#### Return:
```
200: Returns success message.
500: Returns error message logged by the server.
```
### 5. Get Weights 
#### Description:
Returns model weights from Fusion process.
#### Arguments:
```
None
```
#### Return:
```
200: Returns success message.
500: Returns error message logged by the server.
```
