# Getting Started with Edge AI Model Fusion API 
Shared ML learning without shared data.

## Overview
As massive amount of data collected at the edge of network, and is it even feasible or cost effective to transport this data to a central location? As data privacy becomes a key resource as country like Germany with GDPR, data cannot leave the country boundary or data cannot leave the given enterprise premise. 

Model Fusion API solve this problem by on sharing learned Machine Learning models without sharing the raw data distributed across multiple edge sites insuring data privacy, autonomous model learning, and model ensemble from multiple edges. Model Fusion API provides mechanisms to create global and local models when appropriate fine-tune them.
